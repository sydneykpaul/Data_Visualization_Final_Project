**Overview**  
Working with your team, you are to design a dashboard visualization for the Mayor of South Bend. It should interact with one or more of the data sets in a way that provides insights into the data and inform decisions the Mayor must make.  

**Background**  
The Mayor would like to understand more about how disparate South Bend civic data sets interact with each other. Your team has been asked to prepare a presentation to the Mayor for the purposes of demonstrating your dashboard.

**The Data**  
Below is a list of slightly modified data sets from the City of South Bendâ€™s Open Data Portal.
- Business licenses
- City Council districts
- Public facilities
- Parks
- Locations of street lights
